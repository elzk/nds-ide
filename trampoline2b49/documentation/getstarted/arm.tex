\section{ARM}
For ARM target, you can use GNUARM as compiler. Thus, the first section will show you how to compile gcc for ARM achitecture (you can find some binaries on GNUARM website if you prefer \href{http://www.gnuarm.com/}{http://www.gnuarm.com/}).\\
The second section depends on your board. It's the drivers installation to communicate to your board and upload a program.\\

\subsection{GNUARM}
\subparagraph{Unix}
To compile gcc for ARM architecure on UNIX system, follow all the steps below, after having download :
\begin{itemize}
\item binutils-2.19.1
\item gcc-4.4.1
\item newlib-1.17.0
\item gdb-6.8
\end{itemize}

You can download other versions of these softwares, don't forget to change the header below.\
\lstinputlisting{./install.command}

\subparagraph{Windows}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download a GCC-4.0.2 tool chain (\href{http://www.gnuarm.com/bu-2.16.1_gcc-4.0.2-c-c++_nl-1.14.0_gi-6.4.exe}{http://www.gnuarm.com/bu-2.16.1_gcc-4.0.2-c-c++_nl-1.14.0_gi-6.4.exe}).
\item Install only selected components in the below picture. ARM7(ATMEL AT91SAM7S256) in the NXT and in the Olimex board is Little Endian and does not have FPU.
\item Do not check "Install Cygwin DLLs..." because Cygwin was already installed.\\
\item At the end of the installation, you were asked about adding the tool path to Windows Environment Variables, but it would not be needed.
\end{itemize}
