How to run Trampoline on Unix
=============================

Prerequisite
============

Trampoline on Unix uses libpcl. PCL stands for Portable Coroutine Library.
This library is seldom installed from the start on Linux and is surely
not on Mac OS X. The first thing to do is to install libpcl.

1. Get libpcl
-------------

Go to http://xmailserver.org/libpcl.html to download it

An alternate way, if you run the Debian or Ubuntu distribution is to
use apt-get. libpcl packages (libpcl1and libpcl1-dev) are in the testing
packages set.

2. Compile and install it
-------------------------

libpcl follows the usual compiling and installation procedure.
Gunzip and untar the file: tar xvzf pcl-1.6.tar.gz
Then run the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

Under Linux Ubuntu, I discovered youâ€™ll have to run ldconfig to make
the library available for the dynamic linker: sudo /sbin/ldconfig

4. Get Goil
-----------

Trampoline includes the source code of Goil but it is easier to get the
binary of Goil. It can be download from Goil 0.92 executables and templates.
Put goil somewhere and add its path to the PATH environment variable.

How to compile Viper
====================

When run on Unix, Trampoline forks and execve Viper (that can be found in
the directory viper). Viper stands for VIrtual ProcEssor Emulator. Viper
is a multithreaded tiny application that implements timers and send signals
to Trampoline. Commands are sent to Viper by using shared memory segments
to initialize and start timers. When a timer expires, a signal is sent to
Trampoline and act as an interrupt.

Go to the viper subdirectory, then build Viper:
make

How to compile the default application
======================================

A default application is located in the App directory of Trampoline. This
default application uses an alarm and a task. The former activates the later
every second. To build this application, you have to call goil a first time:

goil --target=libpcl --generate-makefile --templates=path/to/templates 
     defaultAppWorkstation.oil
 
goil will generate a Makefile and a Make-rules files (and obviously application
related structures). The Makefile should not be modified directly because it
will be overwritten each time the goil compiler is used. Instead, you can
use the Make-rules files to set appropriate configuration paths.

In the OIL file, some compilation information can be given in the OS section. 
These new keywords are: APP_SRC, CFLAGS, ASFLAGS and LDFLAGS. An example is 
given in App/defaultAppWorkstation.oil.

Then simply type make. A trampoline executable file is generated.

How to compile an application
=============================

The best way is to duplicate the App directory (creating, for instance,
a MyApp directory). In this directory, the tpl_default_tasks_workstation.c
file contains the C functions of the application, the defaultAppWorkstation.oil
file contains the OIL description.
Then update the oil file and give source files in the OS section. Then call
goil explicitely the first time:

goil --target=libpcl --generate-makefile --templates=path/to/templates 
     defaultAppWorkstation.oil

It generate the Makefile. Now, only the 'make' command is necessary when 
updating the application.

That's all.
