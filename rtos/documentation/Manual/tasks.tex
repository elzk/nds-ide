\chapter{Processes}

\strong{Processes} are both Tasks and ISRs category 2. Trampoline category 2 ISRs are like Basic Tasks except the priority level of the interrupt controller is raised to the priority of the ISR while the later is running.

\section{The States of a Process}

A process has a state used by trampoline to perform various actions on the executable when it executes a service. States include those found at page 17 and 18 of the OSEK/VDX specification \ref{osek:taskstate} and 2 extra states used for internal management. The state is coded using 3 bits as shown in table \ref{processstates}.

\begin{table}[htdp]
\caption{States of a process}
\begin{center}
\rowcolors{1}{white}{light-gray}
\begin{longtablev}{c|c|c|c|l}{}{Decimal value}{bit 2}{bit 1}{bit 0}{Meaning}
\linev{0}{0}{0}{0}{SUSPENDED}
\linev{1}{0}{0}{1}{READY}
\linev{2}{0}{1}{0}{RUNNING}
\linev{3}{0}{1}{1}{WAITING}
\linev{4}{1}{0}{0}{AUTOSTART}
\linev{5}{1}{0}{1}{READY\_AND\_NEW}
\end{longtablev}
\end{center}
\label{processstates}
\end{table}%

Figure \ref{fig:states} shows how a process goes from state to state during the lifetime of an application.

\paragraph{AUTOSTART}

This state is used to indicate what task should be started automatically when StartOS is called. An AUTOSTART task is in this initial state but no task should be in this state when the application code is running.

\paragraph{READY\_AND\_NEW}

This state is used to flag a process that is ready but has its context unitialized. This happens when the process has just been activated. The kernel initializes the context of the process the first time it goes to the RUNNING state.

\section{The {\em idle} task}

The "idle" task is launched when no other task is currently running. It keeps the microprocessor doing nothing.\\
To be able to use specific platform capabilities (to put the microcontroler in stand by mode for example), this task is hardware specific (in \textit{machine/}). The taks is then able to quantify the microprocessor occupation.\\
GOIL doesn't produce anything about this idle task (unlike application(s) task(s)). The static part of the idle task descriptor is defined in \file{tpl_os_kernel.c} and we're be able to see that :
\begin{itemize}
\item the priority is 0
\item it's a basic task
\end{itemize}
